## Music Sheet transcriber

* paper: <https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/4/606>
* loss : <https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1292048/file.pdf>
* from sheet to ABC
* Uses CNN for feature encoding, then BLSTM and special loss CTC. Investigate!
* Monophonic ...
* Works quite well, ~10% wrong with only 1 thing to fix. Gets more then notes right

## Music Transciption by Deep Learning paper

* using basic models
* Augmentation seems basic ...
* does not work very well :/
* lossless: Use spectogramms ..., use reverse series ..., image augmentations ..., crop bootstrapping
* lossy: dont use?
* Look at "An end-to-end neural network for polyphonic piano music transcription” ? <https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04243>
* Look at "Convolutional recurrent neural networks for music classification” ? <https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01774>
